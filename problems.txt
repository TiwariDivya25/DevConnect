🔴 Critical Issues
1. Null Safety Violations in ResetPasswordPage
ResetPasswordPage.tsx:17-18

Issue: supabase is possibly null but called without null checks
Impact: Runtime crash when Supabase is unavailable
Lines: 17, 45
2. Security Risk: Admin API Call in Client Code
CreateConversationModal.tsx:43

Issue: Using supabase.auth.admin.listUsers() — this requires service role key, which should never be exposed in client code
Impact: Major security vulnerability; could expose all user data
Fix: Move to server-side API endpoint with proper authentication
3. Missing Null Checks in communityApi
communityApi.ts

Issue: Direct supabase usage without checking if it's null
Impact: Runtime errors in demo mode
🟡 Medium Issues
4. CSS Conflicts in Navbar
Navbar.tsx:155-201

Issue: Classes have both block and flex which conflict
Impact: Unexpected layout behavior
Count: 6 instances
5. Missing Error Handling in useMessaging
useMessaging.ts

Issue: Realtime subscriptions don't handle connection failures
Impact: Silent failures, stale data
6. Inconsistent Error Types
EventDetailPage.tsx:69-73

Issue: Catching unknown but accessing as Error without type guard
Multiple locations: EventDetailPage, MessageInput
7. Memory Leak in useTypingIndicator
useMessaging.ts:294-328

Issue: useEffect cleanup doesn't properly clear typing timeout
Impact: Typing indicators may persist incorrectly
8. No Rate Limiting on Message Send
MessageInput.tsx

Issue: Users can spam messages without throttling
Impact: Database flooding, poor UX
🟢 Low Priority Issues
9. Console.log Left in Production Code
ProfilePage.tsx:88
MessageList.tsx:264
10. Any Type Usage
useEvents.ts:180

Issue: (old: any) loses type safety
Fix: Use proper Event[] type
11. Direct localStorage Access Without Error Handling
Multiple files: ThemeContext, LoginPage, RegisterPage, Footer
Issue: Can throw in private browsing mode
Fix: Wrap in try-catch
12. Missing Dependencies in useEffect
useMessaging.ts:33-51

Issue: startTyping and stopTyping missing from dependency array
Impact: React exhaustive-deps warning, potential stale closures
13. Non-specific Tailwind Classes
Navbar.tsx:95

Info: max-w-[120px] could use Tailwind's max-w-30
14. File Upload Without Size/Type Validation
MessageInput.tsx:78-115

Issue: No max file size or MIME type validation
Impact: Users could upload huge files or malicious content
